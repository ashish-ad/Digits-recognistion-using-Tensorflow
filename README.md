# Digits-recognistion-using-Tensorflow

> First the Model file which used to detect the Digits need to be trained on Python Notebook and then the model file can be used in Python Script.

Pre requisites for the before getting started:

1. Learn Python for [Beginners](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw) , [Intermediate](https://youtu.be/HGOBQPFzWKo). PS: _For faster learning :running: just increase the speed and that will make you lengthy video to get over in shorter as per speed chosen._ 1

2. After learning python jump on to OpenCV form here  [OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o), after going through this you will get the context whats written in the python script or you can simply refer the documentation [OpenCV Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/)

#### This was project made for own interest and wanted to get the overlook of how the python library work.
